# The sarus Suite: Strength in Diversity

Together, **sarus** and **sarus-ui** form a complete network discovery suite:

- Use **sarus** for automation, scripting, and remote operations.
- Use **sarus-ui** for interactive exploration, training, and quick visual assessments.

Both tools share the same core scanning engine, ensuring consistent and reliable results regardless of how you choose to interact with them.

Named after the vigilant Sarus Crane, this project embodies the principles of height, perspective, and precision in network reconnaissance.
